## 🧠 Who I Am

I am an AI-first Software Engineer with experience spanning:

- Scalable web platforms (React, TypeScript, Node)
- Distributed backend systems
- Real-time architectures
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- MLOps pipelines & model lifecycle automation
- Cloud-native infrastructure (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD)

I don’t just build apps.  
I build systems that scale.

I treat AI as an engineering multiplier — not a shortcut.

## 🏗️ Core Engineering Philosophy

```
Build for scale.
Design for clarity.
Ship with ownership.
Optimize for impact.
```

- Production-ready > prototype
- Modular systems > fragile hacks
- Performance measured > performance assumed
- AI-assisted > AI-dependent

# 🧩 3D Interactive Portfolio (Advanced Section)

To truly stand out, embed a 3D animated model banner using:

- Spline
- Three.js
- Vanta.js
- Or a custom WebGL scene

You can host a 3D hero animation like:

> Rotating neural network mesh  
> Floating Kubernetes cluster nodes  
> Animated cloud infrastructure  

Then embed it as:

```md
